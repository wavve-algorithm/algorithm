```python
from collections import Counter

def solution(weights):
    answer = 0
    
    count = Counter(weights)
    
    for k, v in count.items():
        if v >= 2:
            answer += v * (v-1) // 2
    weights = list(set(weights))
    
    for w in weights:
        for check in [2/4, 3/4, 2/3]:
            if w * check in weights:
                answer += count[w] * count[w * check]
    
    return answer
```
